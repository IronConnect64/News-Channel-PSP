1.0
-Local directory scanning for aac and mp3 files
-RSS file output with multiple channel support

1.1
-Added interactive interface with input of "-U"
-Added URL encoding for all special characters

2.0
-If "-U" is present, all other input is ignored
-Added support for out of order input
-Added support for extracting title and author information from ID3 tags
-Supports UTF-16 ID3 tags but only if using standard UTF-8 characters (only if the first byte is null). This is untested because I have no mp3s with UTF-16 encoded tags.

2.1
-Improved code readability (again)
-Improved code divisibility (i.e. made more functions out of current, repetitive code)
-Added common "--help" "/?" methods
-Added verbosity flag which allows various levels of debug output
-Fixed a bug where ignoring an incorrect parameter did not continue onto the next parameter
-Added support for album and track sorting (Uses EXTREMELY inefficient and EXTREMELY horrible sorting code. I just wanted to get something out there. Planning to optimize it with a binary tree sort for version 2.2)
-Added support for Video files (Only supported by PSP firmware 2.80 and up). I still have no way to test this until Devhook for 2.80 is released (which may be never). I know the file is formatted correctly, but I don't know which methods that I've implemented are supported on the PSP.
-Added lots of memory sanity checks
-Changed "aac and mp4" support to "m4a and mp4" support (mp4s are considered to be video by firmware 2.80 and up)

2.1a
-Fixed UTF-16 ID3 tag reading but only if using standard UTF-8 characters (only if the first byte is null). It turned out that Winamp outputs UTF-16 by default... so I bet some people were a tad upset with PSP RSS Feed Generator's lack of support until now.

2.1b
-Fixed bug in Unix(Mac)/Linux version which incorrectly converted apostrophes in titles and filenames.
