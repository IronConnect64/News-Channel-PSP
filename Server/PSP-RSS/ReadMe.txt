PSP RSS feed generator is a commandline based PSP RSS Channel XML file creator intended for beginners' use. It scans a local directory and, based on user input, creates a PSP RSS Channel compatible XML file ready to be hosted on a web site which hosts a folder possessing the same files as the local directory. Currently, it scans the local directory for mp3, m4a, mp4, m4v, jpg, gif, png, tif, and bmp files and places them in the required XML data structure based on the user's input values. These values include the title of the RSS Channel, the image (in the same web directory or a relative web directory) to be used on the PSP to represent the Channel, the local directory to be scanned, the web site directory in which the files are being hosted, and the time zone offset (for date of publish for each file that is added to the channel; the default is +0000). There is also optional input for a Channel description, copyright info, and a URL link. It supports adding new channels to pre-existing xml files, however, the PSP supports 100 entries, at most, per channel. There is a text-based user interface.

Read the commandline help (running the program without input) for more info about usage. The user interface for version 2.0 is fully backward compatible (To the best of my knowledge). Do not input directory values with a slash at the end. The slash is added at runtime.

PSP RSS Feed Generator supports reading title, author, track, album, and genre info directly from mp3 files.

I have successfully compiled version 2.1b in Linux. The command used in Gentoo Linux was "g++ PSP_RSS_feed.cpp -o PSP_RSS_feed" and it ran just like it does in Windows. In order to compile PSP_RSS_feed in Windows, however, you will need a compiler that supports dirent.h. I used DJGPP.

I think the command line help (running the program without input) sufficiently explains this, but... in Windows/DOS, you must use a text file for input if the total commandline is greater than 126 characters. This is a limitation in DOS and was carried over into Windows.
